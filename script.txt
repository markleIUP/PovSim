This is the initializion screen intended for use by IUP researchers conducting this study. Here,
you can adjust the player's starting money, paycheck amounts, and TANF payment
amounts (note: custom settings default to TANF payments as opposed to child support payments)
in addition to the game length. Alternatively, you may select one of the default
presets below which adhere to the numbers initially indicated in the Poverty Simulator game design document.

<!--HOME-->
<div id='homeKids'>
You are cozy in your home. Your kids are running around having fun and
you spend some time playing with them. But in the back of your mind, you know
that there are about a million different things you should be doing right now...
</div>

<div id='homeNoKids'>
You are cozy in your home, but it's not quite the same without your kids. You hope
they come home soon. You spend your time thinking about the million different things
you should be doing right now.
</div>

<div id='homeKidsInBed'>
Your kids have gone to bed. After tucking them in you reflect on your day and think about
what else you need to do in the morning.
</div>

<div id='homeContext'>
Where would you like to go?
</div>

<!--QUICK CASH-->
<div id='quickCashArrive'>
You arrive at the Quick Cash. The interior is dimly lit and smells faintly of mold.
The store is mostly empty of patrons, but the shelves are overflowing with old odds
and ends that have been pawned off over the years. As you enter, a clerk behind the
counter looks up at you briefly before returning to whatever it is he is looking at on his
cell phone.
</div>

div id='quickCashPay'>
The man sets down his phone for a moment and looks at you. "Cashing a check? No problem,"
he says to you. "Usual rates apply."
</div>

<div id='quickCashPayWarning'>
<b>THE QUICK CASH WILL CHARGE YOU 10% OF YOUR TOTAL WEEKLY INCOME TO CASH A PAYCHECK!</b>
</div>

<div id='quickVoucherBuy'>
The cashier sets his phone down after a few seconds and rummages through a drawer. After a few
moments he pulls out a crumpled envelope and looks up at you expectantly. "How many did you
say you wanted?" he asks.
</div>

<div id='quickPay'>
The cashier smiles at you. "Certainly! No problem! Usual rates apply, of course," he says, as
he glances at the sum written on your check. He pops open the cash drawer and looks at you. "Ok?"
</div>

<div id='payAdvance'>
The clerk asks for proof of your previous paycheck and then takes down some of your vital information:
place of employment, employer's phone number, your address, and id number. "A 30% interest charge applies
when you pay us back," he says. "Is that alright?"
</div>

<div id='payQuickBack'>
He pulls a large, faded spiral ring notebook from behind the counter and flips to your last name. He
makes a note of how much you owe and then raises an eyebrow. "How much we payin' back today?"
</div>

<div id='pawn'>
The cashier smiles a toothy grin and you get the feeling that you are a sheep under the gaze of a wolf.
"What, uh, what did you have with you?" he asks.
</div>

<div id='pawnAll'>
He looks carefully at the appliances, plugging them in briefly to ensure they power up, and then flips
through the jewelry with an experienced hand. He clears his throat after a moment and says, "I mean, it's
not really the best quality. This is the best I can do."
</div>

<div id='pawnJewels'> He flips through the jewelry with an experienced hand. He clears his throat after a moment
and says, "It's a little dingy and out of fashion. Here's my offer."
</div>

<div id='pawnApps'>
He plugs them in to ensure they work and then surveys his inventory sitting on the shelves. He scratches his
chin and says, "Here's my offer."
</div>

<div id='confirmPawn'>
You get the distinct feeling that you are being swindled, but you also feel as if you need the money. You think
about what to do for a moment, and then nod you head in assent.
</div>

<!--BANK-->
<div id='bankArrive'>
You enter the double glass doors of the bank and wave half-heartedly at the security guard.
He gives you a stern nod as your shoes click-clack against the polished floor of the building.
The place smells vaguely of bleach. You stand in line for a teller and, after several moments,
you stand before a neatly dressed woman who smiles broadly at you. "How can I help you?"
</div>

<div id='loan'>
The bank offers loans in the quantities of $250, $500, and $1000. How much did you want to ask for?
</div>

<div id='loanDeny'>
You mention taking out a loan and the cashier asks you to wait a moment. She steps away from the counter and,
 a few moments later, returns with a man whom she introduces as the loan manager. He motions toward a door which
 he appears at momentarily. He leads you to a small cubicle, shakes your hand, and asks for a surprisingly
large amount of paperwork and personal questions. After what seems like ages, he frowns, looks up at you and
sadly shakes his head. "Unfortunately, I am unable to offer you a loan given your past credit history and your
current financial situation."
</div>

<div id='loanDeny1'>
You ask the cashier for a loan again. She looks at you for a moment, then goes and grabs the loan manager once more.
He takes you through the same door, goes through the same process, and again, denies your loan. You sigh dejectedly.
</div>

<div id='loanDeny2'>
The cashier shakes her head. "Unfortunately I've been told by the loan manager that we cannot help you with that. You are
free to visit our competitors up the street if you need additional assistance. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
</div>

<div id='bankPaycheck'>
The cashier takes your check and asks for your ID. After verifying your identity and stamping a few papers at a blinding speed
she quickly counts out your money. "Is there anything else I can help with?"
</div>

<div id='noPaycheck'>
She raises an eyebrow. "You uh... need to give me a paycheck to cash one."
</div>

<div id='cashSupBank'>
The cashier flashes a smile. "Of course!" she says. "What will you be cashing?" she asks. Despite her effusive smile
and chipper voice that she is judging you.
</div>

<!--EMPLOYMENT OFFICE-->
<div id='employmentOfficeArrive'>
This space will be filled with something interesting to do... some day.
</div>

<!--UTILITES COMPANY-->
<div id='utilitiesArrive'>
The lobby of the utilities company is small, but welcoming. Pictures of your town from the 1950's and
60's line the walls, and a number of potted plants spruce the place up a bit. Somewhere, from one of the
back offices, you can smell the delicious aroma of coffee. You approach the plexiglass window and a man
with a luxurious mustache greets you. "What can we do for you today?"
</div>

<div id='payUtilitiesText'>
He nods his head. "Of course. How much and which bill would you like to pay?" he asks cordially.
</div>

<!--LANDLORD-->
<div id='landlordArrive'>
As you walk from the bus stop to your landlord's front door you can't help but reflect about how
much nicer her neighborhood is than yours. Every car in every driveway seems shiny and new, and every lawn
is immaculately maintained - probably because of a home owners association requirement. You knock on the
large mahogany doors of her place. After a moment, a housekeeper answers who says he can take your rent check if
that is all you need.
</div>

<div id='payRent'>
The housekeeper says, "Very good. How much will you be paying?"
</div>

<div id='payRentComplete'>
He takes your money, deftly counts it, and closes the door in your face. A moment passes and he opens the door
again and offers you a receipt. "Will there be anything else?" he asks with no curiosity in his voice.
</div>
