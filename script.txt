<div id='welcomeScreen'>
Welcome to IUP's Poverty Simulator. This short game will assess your ability to
juggle the numerous time and monetary constraints placed upon individuals who live
at or close to the poverty line.
</div>

<div id='closingTime'>
A security guard comes up behind you and places her hand on your elbow. "Excuse me," she
says. "But it's closing time. You'll have to come back tomorrow to complete your business." You
protest and say that you'll be just a moment longer, but she shakes her head and leads you to the
doors.
</div>

<!--HOME-->
<div id='evicted'>
Your front door is locked and all of your belongings are piled in a heap next to the curb. An eviction
notice is taped to the front door. And you didn't think this day could get any worse... You reflect on how
much money you have in your bank account and you wonder what you are going to do with your children now. 
</div>

<div id='homeKids'>
You are cozy in your home. Your kids are running around having fun and
you spend some time playing with them. But in the back of your mind, you know
that there are about a million different things you should be doing right now...
</div>

<div id='homeNoKids'>
You are cozy in your home, but it's not quite the same without your kids. You hope
they come home soon. You spend your time thinking about the million different things
you should be doing right now.
</div>

<div id='homeKidsInBed'>
Your kids have gone to bed. After tucking them in you reflect on your day and think about
what else you need to do in the morning.
</div>

<div id='homeContext'>
What would you like to do?
</div>

<!--QUICK CASH-->
<div id='quickClosed'>
You arrive at the Quick Cash. The parking lot is empty, however, and the windows darkened.
You give the door handle a futile tug to confirm it is locked and notice the sign in window.
<br><br> CLOSED <br><br>
Hours: <br>
Sunday - Thursday 7AM to 9PM<br>
Friday and Saturday 7AM to 11PM<br>
</div>


<div id='quickCashArrive'>
You arrive at the Quick Cash. The interior is dimly lit and smells faintly of mold.
The store is mostly empty of patrons, but the shelves are overflowing with old odds
and ends that have been pawned off over the years. As you enter, a clerk behind the
counter looks up at you briefly before returning to whatever it is he is looking at on his
cell phone.
</div>

div id='quickCashPay'>
The man sets down his phone for a moment and looks at you. "Cashing a check? No problem,"
he says to you. "Usual rates apply."
</div>

<div id='quickCashPayWarning'>
<b>THE QUICK CASH WILL CHARGE YOU 10% OF YOUR TOTAL WEEKLY INCOME TO CASH A PAYCHECK!</b>
</div>

<div id='quickVoucherBuy'>
The cashier sets his phone down after a few seconds and rummages through a drawer. After a few
moments he pulls out a crumpled envelope and looks up at you expectantly. "How many did you
say you wanted?" he asks.
</div>

<div id='quickPay'>
The cashier smiles at you. "Certainly! No problem! Usual rates apply, of course," he says, as
he glances at the sum written on your check. He pops open the cash drawer and looks at you. "Ok?"
</div>

<div id='payAdvance'>
The clerk asks for proof of your previous paycheck and then takes down some of your vital information:
place of employment, employer's phone number, your address, and id number. "A 30% interest charge applies
when you pay us back," he says. "Is that alright?"
</div>

<div id='payQuickBack'>
He pulls a large, faded spiral ring notebook from behind the counter and flips to your last name. He
makes a note of how much you owe and then raises an eyebrow. "How much we payin' back today?"
</div>

<div id='pawn'>
The cashier smiles a toothy grin and you get the feeling that you are a sheep under the gaze of a wolf.
"What, uh, what did you have with you?" he asks.
</div>

<div id='pawnAll'>
He looks carefully at the appliances, plugging them in briefly to ensure they power up, and then flips
through the jewelry with an experienced hand. He clears his throat after a moment and says, "I mean, it's
not really the best quality. This is the best I can do."
</div>

<div id='pawnJewels'> He flips through the jewelry with an experienced hand. He clears his throat after a moment
and says, "It's a little dingy and out of fashion. Here's my offer."
</div>

<div id='pawnApps'>
He plugs them in to ensure they work and then surveys his inventory sitting on the shelves. He scratches his
chin and says, "Here's my offer."
</div>

<div id='confirmPawn'>
You get the distinct feeling that you are being swindled, but you also feel as if you need the money. You think
about what to do for a moment, and then nod you head in assent.
</div>

<!--BANK-->
<div id='bankClosed'>
You arrive at the bank, but it is clear that they are closed up for the day. You pull on the door handle just in
case, but it is locked tight. The hours on the door read: "Open Monday-Friday, 7AM to 5PM." Below it, there is another
sign: "Open limited hours on Saturday: 7AM -12PM."
</div>

<div id='bankArrive'>
You enter the double glass doors of the bank and wave half-heartedly at the security guard.
He gives you a stern nod as your shoes click-clack against the polished floor of the building.
The place smells vaguely of bleach. You stand in line for a teller and, after several moments,
you stand before a neatly dressed woman who smiles broadly at you. "How can I help you?"
</div>

<div id='loan'>
The bank offers loans in the quantities of $250, $500, and $1000. How much did you want to ask for?
</div>

<div id='loanDeny'>
You mention taking out a loan and the cashier asks you to wait a moment. She steps away from the counter and,
 a few moments later, returns with a man whom she introduces as the loan manager. He motions toward a door which
 he appears at momentarily. He leads you to a small cubicle, shakes your hand, and asks for a surprisingly
large amount of paperwork and personal questions. After what seems like ages, he frowns, looks up at you and
sadly shakes his head. "Unfortunately, I am unable to offer you a loan given your past credit history and your
current financial situation."
</div>

<div id='loanDeny1'>
You ask the cashier for a loan again. She looks at you for a moment, then goes and grabs the loan manager once more.
He takes you through the same door, goes through the same process, and again, denies your loan. You sigh dejectedly.
</div>

<div id='loanDeny2'>
The cashier shakes her head. "Unfortunately I've been told by the loan manager that we cannot help you with that. You are
free to visit our competitors up the street if you need additional assistance. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
</div>

<div id='bankPaycheck'>
The cashier takes your check and asks for your ID. After verifying your identity and stamping a few papers at a blinding speed
she quickly counts out your money. "Is there anything else I can help with?"
</div>

<div id='noPaycheck'>
She raises an eyebrow. "You uh... need to give me a paycheck to cash one."
</div>

<div id='cashSupBank'>
The cashier flashes a smile. "Of course!" she says. "What will you be cashing?" she asks. Despite her effusive smile
and chipper voice that she is judging you.
</div>

<!--EMPLOYMENT OFFICE-->
<div id='noOvertime'>
Your manager swings by your cubicle just as you close you turn off your monitor. "Great job today," she
says enthusiastically. "Just remember, though. No overtime!" And then she walks away suddenly, presumably to yell
remind the others about the 'No Overtime' policy.
</div>

<div id='workClosed'>
You arrive at work, but the doors are locked up tight. Guess you'll have to come back later...
</div>

<div id='employmentOfficeArrive'>
You arrive and rub the sleep from your eyes. Flourescent lights blare down on you. After a quick trip to the coffee
machine you find your way to your cubicle and sit down for another day of monotony.
Your job is boring, but at least you have a lot of free time on your hands....
</div>

<div id='ticTacToe'>

</div>

<!--UTILITES COMPANY-->
<div id='utilitiesClosed'>
The exterior of the building is lit up like a Christmas tree, but the windows are dark. You press your face to
the glass and confirm that they are closed. A sign on the window reads: "Office Hours: 7AM - 5PM, 7 Days a Week."
</div>

<div id='utilitiesArrive'>
The lobby of the utilities company is small, but welcoming. Pictures of your town from the 1950's and
60's line the walls, and a number of potted plants spruce the place up a bit. Somewhere, from one of the
back offices, you can smell the delicious aroma of coffee. You approach the plexiglass window and a man
with a luxurious mustache greets you. "What can we do for you today?"
</div>

<div id='payUtilitiesText'>
He nods his head. "Of course. How much and which bill would you like to pay?" he asks cordially.
</div>

<!--LANDLORD-->
<div id='landlordClosed'>
You walk the short distance to your landlord's house and ring the bell next to the opulent front
doors. After a moment, the housekeeper answers, looks at you a moment, and rudely says, "No solicitors
after five," before he slams the door in your face. You stare at the door a moment and turn around. You guess
you'll have to come back later.
</div>

<div id='landlordArrive'>
As you walk from the bus stop to your landlord's front door you can't help but reflect about how
much nicer her neighborhood is than yours. Every car in every driveway seems shiny and new, and every lawn
is immaculately maintained - probably because of a home owners association requirement. You knock on the
large mahogany doors of her place. After a moment, a housekeeper answers who says he can take your rent check if
that is all you need.
</div>

<div id='payRent'>
The housekeeper says, "Very good. How much will you be paying?"
</div>

<div id='payRentComplete'>
He takes your money, deftly counts it, and closes the door in your face. A moment passes and he opens the door
again and offers you a receipt. "Will there be anything else?" he asks with no curiosity in his voice.
</div>

<!--GROCERY STORE-->
<div id='grocerArrive'>
The outside of the building is harsh, Brutalist architecture. In the window, an orange "24/7" neon light glows. You walk
through the sliding glass doors of the grocery store and are beset by the cold glow of fluorescent bulbs.
The scent of freshly baked goods drifts towards you as you make your way towards the front of the store, where a man
with a thin mustache greets you.
</div>

<div id='buyGroceriesNow'>
You grab a basket a peruse the aisles, carefully checking the cost of everything. After buying enough food to last the
week for you and your kids, you sigh, knowing the damage is going to be substantial. You take your cart to the front of the
store and unload everything. After the cash register rings everything up, she smiles at you cheerfully. "And how will you be
paying today?" she asks.
</div>

<div id='alreadyHaveGroceries'>
You reflect on how much food you still have in the pantry at home and decide that you probably have enough food for the week.
</div>

<div id='deferGroceryPay'>
The cashier gives you a plastic smile. "Of course," she says. "We'll just add it to your tab."
</div>

<div id='grocAcceptMoney'>
The cashier deftly counts your cash and makes a note on your tab of how much you have paid off. Then, she smiles at you and asks,
"Anything else?"
</div>

<div id='grocNotEnoughMoney'>
The cashier counts out your money and pauses halfway through. "I'm sorry. I think you may have made a mistake," she says. "You don't
seem to have enough money here."
</div>

<div id='payGroceryBillNow'>
The cashier nods. "And how much of your total would you like to pay off today?"
</div>
